                    <p>We aim to provide a seamless and satisfactory experience to all our users. However, due to the nature of AGOMPS UPPLâ€™s services, the following refund policy applies:</p>

                    <h3>1. Registration Fees</h3>
                    <p>Registration fees for tournaments or events are non-refundable once paid. Please ensure that all details are correct before submitting your registration.</p>

                    <h3>2. Cancellation by AGOMPS UPPL</h3>
                    <p>If AGOMPS UPPL cancels an event or tournament for any reason, we will offer a refund to all registered participants, or provide an alternative solution such as transferring the registration to a future event.</p>

                    <h3>3. Refund Requests</h3>
                    <p>If you feel there are exceptional circumstances that warrant a refund, please contact us within 7 days of the payment. Refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be subject to approval.</p>

                    <h3>4. No Refunds for Participation Fees</h3>
                    <p>Once a participant has engaged in a tournament, no refunds will be granted, even in cases of early withdrawal or disqualification.</p>

                    <h3>5. Payment Processing Fees</h3>
                    <p>Any processing fees charged by payment processors (e.g., bank or credit card fees) are non-refundable.</p>

                    <p>For any refund-related queries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@agomps.com">contact@agomps.com</a>.</p>
